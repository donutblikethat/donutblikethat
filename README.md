it is simple... don't act how you were before this was sent to you

# what the fuck? this offends me!

this repository is not meant to be offensive but to be a reminder to be kind to others. you can be mad, but that doesn't change the truth. sure, this language is extremely intense, offensive, and vulgar but it gets a point across rapidly. 
do not be mad at the messenger but the person who sent the site to you.

# i would like to send you hate mail

# remember to always be kind
maybe tone it down a bit... they sent this to you for a reason. you can do it - cheers!
